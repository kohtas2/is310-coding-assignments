**Arsenal 24-25 Season Score Predictor**

This is a Python-based terminal program designed to display the ongoing 24-25 football season's match results for Arsenal and collect user predictions for upcoming games. It uses the rich library to display the table of results and predictions in a visually appealing format and saves the data to a CSV file for future reference.

1. The script will display the current seasonâ€™s match results.
2. You will be prompted to enter score predictions for future games:
    - Enter the match date.
    - Enter the opponent's name.
    - Enter your score prediction for the match.
    - You can make this up!
3. You will then be asked to confirm the data: Type "Y" to confirm the input or "R" to re-enter the information.
4. Once confirmed, the prediction is added to the table and displayed in the terminal.
5. When you're finished entering predictions, type "N" when prompted for the match date.
6. The program will automatically save all match data (including your predictions) to a CSV file in the same directory.
