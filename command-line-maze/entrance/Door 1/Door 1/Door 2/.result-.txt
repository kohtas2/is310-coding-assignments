Your breath quickens as you approach the final chamber, anticipation swelling in your chest. But as you step forward, the eerie silence fills the air. The spot where the treasure should have been is empty, a faint outline of dust the only remnant of what once rested there. You search frantically, but it's no use. The treasure has been takenâ€”claimed by someone before you. The clues, the riddles, the trials... all led you here, only to find that you are too late. The treasure is gone, slipping through your fingers like sand in an hourglass. You missed it.
