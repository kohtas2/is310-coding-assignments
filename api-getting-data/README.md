# API Selection:
- Europeana API: The Europeana API provides access to millions of digitized items from European cultural heritage institutions, including artworks, books, films, and museum objects. I chose this API because it offers a rich and diverse collection of cultural artifacts, which aligns well with the focus of this assignment on curating and retrieving cultural data.
- Smithsonian Open Access API: The Smithsonian API offers open access to a vast array of metadata and media content from the Smithsonian museums. I selected this API due to its comprehensive collection of scientific, artistic, and historical resources, making it a great complement to the Europeana API in terms of retrieving cultural and educational data across different geographic regions and topics.
